# Policy Cleanup Fix Summary

## Problem Description
When changing permissions from selective types (`selected_by_creator`, `selected_ids`) to non-selective types (`all`, `self`), the old selective access data (`SelectedCreators`, `SelectedIds`) was not being properly cleaned up. This was causing issues where:

1. **selected_by_creator → all**: `SelectedCreators` data remained
2. **selected_by_creator → self**: `SelectedCreators` data remained  
3. **selected_ids → all**: `SelectedIds` data remained
4. **selected_ids → self**: `SelectedIds` data remained

This issue occurred in ALL scenarios: role creation, role editing, user overrides, and direct role updates.

## Root Cause
The cleanup logic in `_clean_selective_access_data` function used `elif` statements, which meant that cleanup only happened for the first matching condition. When changing to "all", it would clean up but skip checking for other permission changes. When changing to "self" or other non-selective permissions, no cleanup would occur at all.

## Fix Implementation

### 1. Fixed Core Cleanup Logic (`policies.py`)
**Before:**
```python
if "all" in permission_value:
    # Clean up code
elif "selected_by_creator" not in permission_value:
    # Clean up SelectedCreators  
elif "selected_ids" not in permission_value:
    # Clean up SelectedIds
```

**After:**
```python
# Always clean up SelectedCreators if permission doesn't include selected_by_creator
if "selected_by_creator" not in permission_value:
    # Clean up SelectedCreators
    
# Always clean up SelectedIds if permission doesn't include selected_ids  
if "selected_ids" not in permission_value:
    # Clean up SelectedIds
```

### 2. Added Cleanup to All Policy Processing Functions

#### A. `normalize_policies_compat` (used in role creation)
- Added cleanup logic after processing allow permissions
- Ensures new roles don't have conflicting data

#### B. `deep_merge_policies` (used for merging updates)
- Already had cleanup logic - now uses improved cleanup function
- Used for backward compatibility where merging behavior is needed

#### C. `deep_replace_policies` (used for direct role edits)
- Already had cleanup logic - now uses improved cleanup function
- Implements replacement behavior for direct role updates

#### D. `merge_role_with_overrides` (used for user-specific overrides)
- Added cleanup logic when processing Allow permissions
- Ensures user overrides properly clean up conflicting data

## Test Coverage

### 1. Comprehensive Cleanup Tests (`test_comprehensive_cleanup.py`)
- Tests all permission change scenarios (selected → all, selected → self, etc.)
- Tests mixed permission changes in same module
- Tests cleanup preserves relevant data
- Tests empty container removal
- **9 test cases, all passing**

### 2. Direct Role Replacement Tests (`test_direct_role_replacement.py`)
- Tests replacement vs merging behavior
- Tests partial replacement scenarios
- **4 test cases, all passing**

### 3. User Override Cleanup Tests (`test_override_cleanup.py`)
- Tests user override cleanup scenarios
- Tests selective preservation of unchanged data
- **4 test cases, all passing**

### 4. Existing Tests Still Pass
- All existing policy cleanup tests: **3 passing**
- All existing role management tests: **28 passing**

**Total: 48 tests passing**

## Scenarios Now Fixed

### ✅ Role Creation
- Creating role with `allow: ["all"]` and `SelectedCreators` → `SelectedCreators` removed
- Creating role with `allow: ["self"]` and `SelectedIds` → `SelectedIds` removed

### ✅ Role Editing (Direct Updates)
- Edit role: `selected_by_creator` → `all` → `SelectedCreators` cleaned up
- Edit role: `selected_ids` → `self` → `SelectedIds` cleaned up
- Edit role: `selected_by_creator` → `self` → `SelectedCreators` cleaned up

### ✅ User Overrides
- Override: `selected_by_creator` → `all` → `SelectedCreators` cleaned up
- Override: `selected_ids` → `self` → `SelectedIds` cleaned up
- Partial overrides preserve unaffected data

### ✅ Mixed Scenarios
- Multiple actions in same module changing simultaneously
- Some actions changing, others staying selective
- Empty containers automatically removed

## Production Safety
- **Backward Compatible**: All existing functionality preserved
- **No Breaking Changes**: All existing tests pass
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: 17+ new test cases cover edge cases
- **Clean Data**: No orphaned selective access data
- **Consistent Behavior**: Same cleanup logic across all update paths

## Code Quality
- **DRY Principle**: Single cleanup function used everywhere
- **Clear Logic**: Simplified conditional structure
- **Well Tested**: Comprehensive test suite
- **Documented**: Clear function documentation and comments
